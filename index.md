## What is CV Medical Software?

Health care facilities are challenged every day to provide the best care for patients with cardiovascular disease. But the guidelines for reducing heart failure and other CVD risks change at a rapid pace and arenâ€™t always easy for providers to keep up with. Even the most experienced medical professionals struggle to stay on top of the complex, algorithmic evolution of heart health guidelines. Furthermore, as the chronic disease burden, especially in rural areas grows and chronic disease care shifts to the midlevel providers, the expertise to manage complex chronic disease becomes less available.

The result is more heart failure readmission, more scrutiny from insurance providers, less reimbursements, and an overall healthcare system in crisis. Patients, health care providers and insurers alike are frustrated by the lack of a reliable chronic care management platform that brings modern solutions to the problems surrounding cardiovascular and other related chronic diseases such as chronic kidney disease and pulmonary hypertension.
